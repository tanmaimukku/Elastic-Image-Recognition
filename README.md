## Notes

1. I have strictly followed the instructions on Canvas, including the delay times mentioned. Because of this, when I display the message count after pulling, it is still 1, and when I display the queues after deletion, the queue is still listed, even though both the message and the queue have been deleted. If we increase the time delay, these changes are reflected, but I didn't do so as I strictly followed Canvas instructions. 

2. The AWS credentials are present in a .env file that is loaded at the start of the program. User doesn't need to explicitly load them.
